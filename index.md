## ðŸ”¬ Overview

This research introduces an **adaptive Koopman-based force control framework** that improves precision and adaptability in robotic swabbing. The approach leverages **data-driven centroid-based force regulation**, ensuring optimal contact force across different surfaces.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- **Koopman Operator for Nonlinear Dynamics**: A linearized model improves control efficiency.
- **Fuzzy Centroid-Based Correction**: Real-time force distribution monitoring.
- **Comparison with Standard Control Methods**: Evaluated against PID and SMC.
- **Experimental Validation**: Demonstrates effectiveness in industrial applications.
