# 🚀 SA-KLQR: Adaptive Koopman-Based Force Control

## 🔬 Overview
This project introduces **SA-KLQR**, an advanced **adaptive Koopman-based force control framework** for deformable tool manipulation (DTM). Our approach enhances **force regulation, trajectory adaptation, and real-time compliance** in robotic swabbing.

> *"Ensuring precision in force control is key to effective robotic swabbing."*

🌟 **Key Contributions:**
✅ **Koopman-Based Linearization** – Accurately models force dynamics in DTM.  
✅ **SA-KLQR Control Framework** – Integrates Koopman operators with optimal LQR control.  
✅ **Centroid-Based Fuzzy Regulation** – Ensures uniform force distribution and tool stability.  
✅ **Robotic Swabbing Case Study** – Evaluates performance in industrial hygiene applications.

## 📊 Experimental Results
Below is a **performance comparison** between SA-KLQR and other force controllers.

| **Method**      | **RMSE (N)** | **MAE (N)** | **Force Error (%)** |
|---------------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **SA-KLQR**   | 0.006      | 0.002      | **3%** ✅ |
| **PID**       | 0.12       | 0.08       | 10% ❌ |
| **SMC**       | 0.09       | 0.07       | 7% ❌ |
